Club Compass is built with a modern tech stack and is designed to be scalable and maintainable.

### Goals

1. Builds and brings together communities
2. Helps students find their passions
3. Encourages hard work and goal setting
4. Increases academic and extracurricular motivation
5. Recognizes and improves upon the struggles with current club systems in schools
